# maybe do a dry-run first:
'rsync -azvAX --dry-run hamath@192.168.1.101:/mnt/hdd/ /mnt/HDD/server-hdd/'
# then actually do it:
'rsync -azAX --info=progress2 hamath@192.168.1.101:/mnt/hdd/ /mnt/HDD/server-hdd/'
# add '--delete' to remove deleted files
# FYI: the first is the source, the secound is where it gets placed (Put slashes (/) at the end of both to copy the contents of the source into the target. Without them the whole of the source would get upt into the target.)
